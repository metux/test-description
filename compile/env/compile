# Platform independent make options

# All of them can be overwritten by compile/ARCH file settings
#
# @ADD_MAKE_OPTIONS:	this variable specifies platform independent make
# 			options. They are added to the make call. This value
#			is overwritten by the platform dependent compile
#			options, if there the same variable is set.
# @BUILD_TARGET:	this option should be set, if the Linux kernel version
# 			that should be built is < 4.4 . In this case the make
#			target "bindeb-pkg" doesn't exist. Use "deb-pgk" as
#			BUILD_TARGET. (default is "bindeb-pgk")
# @			In this file, environment variables make uses can be
# 			defined as well.
