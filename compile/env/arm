# Kernel compile environment settings for ARCH, platform dependent
#
# The naming convention for the file name is
#     compile/ARCH
#
# Mandatory environment variables for cross builds:
# @CROSS_COMPILE:	Needs to be defined (not for x86, because build server
#  			is x86 based)
#
# Optional environment variables:
# @MKDTBS: 	        If this variable is set to true the device tree binaries
#  			defined in the kernel configuration are	built
#
# see compile/compile.properties : all those configuration parameters can be
# set in the ARCH specific configuration file. The general settings are then
# overwritten by the ARCH specific settings.
